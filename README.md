## Community Members and Recruits

1. A community members may request clan membership, either by applying in the appropriate Discord channel, or during a clan event at which a clan member of at least Officer rank is present. 

2. A community member who is granted membership is given the probationary -CE- tags and is added to the Member Discord role. 

3. A Recruit with -CE- tags must participate in either the clan Discord or in clan events for a period of at least a week, during which they are observed by other members of the clan. If the other members raise any objections, depending on severity, the -CE- Member is either removed from the clan, or their probationary period is extended by another week. A -CE- Member may request that their probationary period be extended if they are unable to participate in clan activities during this time. If, after the probationary period, no objections are raised, the -CE- tags are removed, and the Member is given the full =CE= tags. 

## Clan Members

1. =CE= Members may apply to join Groups that match their areas of interest. 

2. Members are not subject to an activity check and may choose to participate in clan activites at their leisure.

## Officers

1. Officers will comprise of a certain, yet-to-be-determined ratio of total clan members. If the number of Officers is less than this number, Members will be put forward as candidates by other Officers and Leaders, as chosen by merit and interest in clan leadership. Once a candidate is chosen by vote, the Member is promoted to the Officer role. 

2. Officers are expected to maintain a presence on the Discord or participate in clan events. An Officer who does not either participate in at least 1 clan event or post at least 1 message on Discord over the course of a month will be contacted by other members. If they fail to respond to this contact, they will be demoted to Member, and a replacement will be chosen. If they are able to provide a valid reason for their inactivity, or else indicate that they will be inactive beforehand, they will be allowed to remain at their current rank, though repeated usage of this privilege is grounds for demotion. 

## Leaders

1. Leaders will comprise of a certain, yet-to-be-determined ratio of total clan members, with a smaller total number than number of Officers. If the number of Leaders is less than this number, Officers will be put forward as candidates by other Leaders, as chosen by merit and interest in clan leadership. Once a candidate is chosen by vote, the Officer is promoted to the Leader role, and given the "fancy" «CE» tags. 

2. Leaders are expected to maintain a presence on the Discord or participate in clan events. A Leader who does not either participate in at least 1 clan event or post at least 1 message on Discord over the course of a month will be contacted by other members. If they fail to respond to this contact, they will be demoted to Member, and a replacement will be chosen. If they are able to provide a valid reason for their inactivity, or else indicate that they will be inactive beforehand, they will be allowed to remain at their current rank, though repeated usage of this privilege is grounds for demotion. 


## Future Topics of Discussion 

1. With the loss of a dedicated Administrator role, instead those members who host servers for the clan are allowed to administrate at their leisure, though they should follow a set of guidelines, the nature of which needs to be considered. 

2. The exact ratio of Leaders/Officers/Members needs to be determined. 

3. We need to look at what channels in Discord are more appropriate as Group channels.
